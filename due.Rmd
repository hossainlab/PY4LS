title: "What is Due & When?"
author: "Alison Hill"
subtitle: Summer 2018

You are expected to come to each class meeting prepared, which means that you will have done the readings and the DataCamp assignments that are due for that date *before* coming to class. 

## Readings

Readings will primarily be from two free, open-source, completely online textbooks:

1. [**MODERN DIVE into Data with R (MD)**](http://moderndive.netlify.com) 
1. [**R for Data Science (R4DS)**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) 

These books will be supplemented by blog posts, YouTube videos, and several open-access articles, including from:

- A special PEERJ issue called ["Practical Data Science for Stats"](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/), and
- [Nature: Points of Significance](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance)

## DataCamp

Be sure to check the **DataCamp** link above for more details on the DataCamp (DC) assignments.  

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(DT)
due <- read_csv("due.csv") %>%
  mutate(Date = paste(Month, Day)) %>%
  mutate(`DataCamp Due` = ifelse(material == "-" | grepl("Quiz", material) | is.na(material_link),
    material,
    paste0("<a href='", material_link, "'>", material, "</a>"))) %>% 
  mutate(`Lab Due` = ifelse(ps == "-" | is.na(ps) | is.na(ps_link),
    ps,
    paste0("<a href='", ps_link, "'>", ps, "</a>"))) %>% 
  mutate(big_lab_due = ifelse(big_lab == "-" | is.na(big_lab) | is.na(big_lab_link),
    big_lab,
    paste0("<a href='", big_lab_link, "'>", big_lab, "</a>"))) %>% 
  select(Weekday, Date, `CM / Block`, `Readings Due` = Reading, 
         `DataCamp Due`, `Lab Due`, `Integrative Lab Due` = big_lab_due)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if(knitr:::is_html_output()){
  due %>% 
    datatable(rownames = FALSE,
              class = 'cell-border stripe',
              filter = list(position = 'top'),
              options = list(pageLength = nrow(due), 
                             autoWidth = TRUE,
                             bInfo = FALSE,
                             paging = FALSE),
              escape = FALSE)
} else {
  knitr::kable(due, booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE)
}
```
