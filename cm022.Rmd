# Overview

In the [previous lab](cm021.html), we conducted a new exploratory data analysis with the `crime` data, which involved three things:

- Looking at the raw values.
- Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest.
- Creating informative visualizations.

In this lab, we'll start where we left off! Refer back to the [lab solutions](cm021-solutions.html) to see the code we used to do the EDA.

- A complete knitted `html` file is due on Sakai by beginning of class Tuesday July 24th (2:30pm). 
- This lab is estimated to take approximately 45 minutes. We'll work together in chunks to keep tabs on time, with the aim that we all *finish* during the in-class work period. 
- This lab is based on [Chapter 6: Basic Regression in ModernDive](http://moderndive.netlify.com/6-regression.html). Please open it and follow closely!
- You'll need to load these packages to do the lab (make sure they are installed first, not in your .Rmd file!):
```{r load_packages, include = TRUE}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

Let's investigate how well we can predict criminals (per 100k population) from the number of public houses (ale/beer houses per 100k population) using simple linear regression. Here is how to read in the data (please copy and paste into a code chunk in your .Rmd):


```{r crime_data, include = TRUE}
crimenames <- c("county", "region_name", "region_code",
               "criminals", "public_houses", "school_attendance",
               "worship_attendance")

crime <- read_table(here::here("data", "beerhall.dat"),
                    col_names = crimenames)
```

Recall we are using the `crime` dataset with:

- Outcome variable / dependent variable / response variable / y = `criminals`
- Predictor variable / independent variable / explanatory variable / x = `public_houses`

Here is the linear regression formula: 
$$\hat{\textrm{criminals}} = b_0 + b_1{\textrm{public_houses}}$$

# EDA

Refer back to the [lab solutions](cm021-solutions.html) to see the code we used to do the EDA.


# [Simple linear regression](http://moderndive.netlify.com/6-regression.html#model1table) (⏰ 20 min)

**Part 1:** First “fit” the linear regression model to the data using the `lm()` function, then apply the `get_regression_table()` function from the `moderndive` R package to the model object. Use the output to fill in this formula with `y`, `x`, and the intercept and slope coefficients: (copy and paste into your narative: `$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1{x}$$`)

$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1{x}$$

**Part 2:** Interpret the intercept coefficient and the slope coefficient (see [here](http://moderndive.netlify.com/6-regression.html#model1table) for an example). How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above?

```{r}
crime_lm <- lm(criminals ~ public_houses, data = crime)
get_regression_table(crime_lm)
```

# [Observed/fitted values and residuals](http://moderndive.netlify.com/6-regression.html#model1points) (⏰ 20 min)

**Part 1:** What are the observed and fitted values for the Cornwall (`ID` = 20) and Monmouth regions (`ID` = 23)? Which region do you think the reverend called "the happiest example of the infrequency of crime"?

```{r}
regression_points <- get_regression_points(crime_lm)
regression_points %>% 
  filter(ID %in% c(20, 23))
```

**Part 2:** In fact, we could argue with the reverend about the happiest example of the infrequency of crime. There are two ways you could define this, and you'll do with with a `filter` using the `|` operator (think: `or`). 

The first way is that the county had the lowest criminals overall. The second is that the county had the lowest criminals *given their number of public houses*. This would mean that the region has the lowest observed criminals, compared to the fitted value based on predicting criminals from public houses. You'll need to match the `ID` column as a row in the original data (you can just do this visually by comparing the tibbles and typing your answers in your narrative- you don't have to do a join here).

```{r}
# Derby is lowest residual (ID = 20)
# Cornwall is the lowest observed (ID = 33)
regression_points %>% 
  filter(criminals == min(criminals) | residual == min(residual))

regression_points %>% 
  left_join(select(crime, county, criminals, public_houses)) %>% 
  filter(criminals == min(criminals) | residual == min(residual))
```

# [Residual analysis](http://moderndive.netlify.com/6-regression.html#model1residuals) (⏰ 20 min)

**Part 1:** Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Ideally, there should be little to no pattern- why? Does it seem like there is no systematic pattern to the residuals? 
  
```{r crime_resid_scatter}
ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = public_houses, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Public Houses", y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)
```



**Part 2:** Recreate this density plot of the residuals (hint: `?geom_vline()`). Recall that we would like the residuals to be normally distributed with mean 0. Use `dplyr` to calculate the mean of the residuals- is it (pretty close to) 0? Do you think you have more positive residuals than negative, or vice versa?

```{r crime_resid_density}
ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "Residual") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), color = "red")
```

![](`r knitr::fig_chunk('crime_resid_density','png')`)

```{r}
regression_points %>% 
  summarize(mean_resid = mean(residual))
```
