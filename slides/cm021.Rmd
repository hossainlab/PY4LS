## How to do peer review well:

- Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.

--

- Be specific and concise.

--

- Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.

--

- If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.

--

- Use criteria to evaluate and comment on:
    - _Coding style:_ Is code readable? Are there comments that help?
    - _Coding strategy:_ Do you notice places where the code could be improved upon or simplified? Any functions you know or strategies that you used that the author could benefit from?
    - _Narrative organization:_ Do you know what section you are "in" when you are reading? Can you follow their steps *without* reading the code or seeing the output? Did they use markdown formatting to help create a narrative structure?
    - _Narrative quality:_ Does the author interpret anything or use words in complete sentences? Or do they leave it all to the “reader” to figure out what is happening and why?
