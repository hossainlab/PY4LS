## Hi & welcome!


---
## Where are we going?

![](http://moderndive.netlify.com/images/flowcharts/flowchart/flowchart.002.png)

---
## Learning outcomes

-	Develop and clearly describe a statistical analysis plan, from start to finish.

--

-	Work independently with data, including wrangling, tidying, visualizing, and basic analyses.

--

-	Accurately interpret results from basic inferential statistical analyses.

--

-	Understand assumptions and limitations to statistical procedures.

--

-	Know about the types/scope of questions one can ask about data.

--

-	Identify statistical questions/problems that require advanced methods out of skill set.

--

-	Proficient use of tools and vocabulary to facilitate effective collaboration with advisors, biostatisticians, and other team members.

---
## How will we get there?

- ModernDive
- R4DS
- DataCamp.com
- Blogs, YouTube, PEERJ, Nature, etc.

## Safe-stats


> *"Statisticians have a tendency to advocate statistical abstinence: you should only practice statistics if you’re in a long-term relationship with a statistician (Wickham 2015). But abstinence-based education rarely works. People see their friends using statistics and having a great time, and there simply aren’t enough statisticians to go around. As a field, we need to teach safe-stats, not just statistical abstinence."*

## Your articles

- Find a partner
- Share with each other terms from each of your articles that:
    - you didn’t know,
    - you have heard before but can’t define or explain to other people, or
    - you can’t actually do (i.e., if you had their data, could you replicate?)
- Use this link to add terms
