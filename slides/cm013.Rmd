## Objects and functions

> "To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
- Everything that exists is an object, and 
- Everything that happens is a function call."

## To make your `mutate` "stick"

```{r eval = FALSE}
heart_bp <- heart_bp %>% 
  mutate(bp_ratio = BPXDI1 / BPXDI2)
```

## It's (probably) you, not R 

https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/6-errors.html

- `Error: could not find function`
- `Error: object not found`
- Misspellings
- Unmatched parentheses
- Missing commas
- Package not installed
- Package not loaded

Consider trying `sessionInfo()` in your script to make sure the package you think you are using is there!

---

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

## How to ask for help

Key idea: make a "minimal reproducible example" (abbreviated: `REPREX`)

--

Minimum requirements:

- Use the smallest, simplest, most built-in data possible [(see next slide!)](#data).
- Include commands on a strict ‚Äúneed to run‚Äù basis.
- Whitespace rationing is not in effect.


From: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html

---
name: data
## Built-in data

A few good options always:

```{r eval = FALSE}
iris
mtcars
airquality
ChickWeight
ToothGrowth
PlantGrowth
```

All of these are "built-in" datasets in R that you can just use and assume that *we* can also just use! üéâ

---
## Make a tibble by column

Using the `tibble` package...

```{r}
o2_by_col <- tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = letters[1:5]
)
o2_by_col
```

https://tibble.tidyverse.org

---
## Make a tibble by row

```{r}
o2_by_row <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  1, 2, "a",
  3, 4, "b",
  5, 6, "c"
)
o2_by_row
```

---
## This seems like a lot of work!

["Yes, creating a great reprex requires work. You are asking other people to do work too. It‚Äôs a partnership. 80% of the time you will solve your own problem in the course of writing an excellent reprex. YMMV." -Jenny Bryan](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)

To ask/get help, you'll:

- Use the smallest, simplest, most built-in data possible [(see next slide!)](#data); and include code for it!
- Include only code needed to reproduce the error (note that you should have opened a new file and tried it yourself first!)
- Try to format things to make it easier on us- indentations and spaces help!

## I'm assuming...

You have:

- a working version of R,

- a working version of RStudio,

- completed DataCamp's "Introduction to the Tidyverse" (all 4 chapters)

- read chapters 1.1, 2, and 3 in ModernDive

- read chapter 4 in R4DS

## DC Chapter 1: Data Wrangling


.pull-left[

- print a tibble
  - `heart`

- install a package 
  - `install.packages("dplyr")`
  - do 1x per machine

- load an installed package
  - `library(dplyr)`
  - do 1x per work session

- assign a variable a name (`<-`, think "gets") 

- `%>%` (think "then")
]

.pull-right[

- `dplyr::filter`

- `dplyr::arrange`

- `dplyr::mutate`

## DC Chapter 2: Data Visualization

all `ggplot2`

- `aes(x = , y = )` (aesthetics)
- `aes(x = , y = , color = )` (add color)
- `aes(x = , y = , size = )` (add size)
- `+ facet_wrap(~ )` (facetting)

## DC Chapter 3: Grouping & Summarizing

- `dplyr::summarize`

class: middle, center, inverse

# ‚åõÔ∏è

## Let's review some helpful functions for `summarize`

*especially useful for* `summarize`

*even more useful after a* `group_by`

See:

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#summarise-funs

---

```{r include = FALSE}
summary_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Description, ~Usage,
  "sum", "sum(x)",
  "minimum", "min(x)",
  "maximum", "max(x)",
  "mean", "mean(x)",
  "median", "mean(x)",
  "standard deviation", "sd(x)",
  "variance", "var(x)",
  "rank", "rank(x)"
)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(summary_table, format = "html")
```

* All allow for `na.rm` argument to remove `NA` values before summarizing. The default setting for this argument is *always* `na.rm = FALSE`, so if there is one `NA` value the summary will be `NA`.

* See "Maths Functions" in the RStudio Base R Cheatsheet:

## Summary statistics

Generally index one of three:

1. Center
1. Spread
1. Shape

We'll focus on the first two, will return to the third.

---
## Center

What are some ways we can measure "central tendency"?

--

1. Mean (`mean`)

--

1. Median (`median`)

--

1. Mode (not terribly helpful)

--

Measures of central tendency: The mean

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3127352/

---
## Spread

What are some ways we can measure "variation"?

--

- range (`range`), 

--

- standard deviation (`sd`), 

--

- inter-quartile range (`IQR`)

## Datasets Exercise Part 1

```{r include = FALSE}
library(datasauRus)
cm013 <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  arrange(dataset) %>% 
  mutate(counter = case_when(
    row_number() == 1 ~ 1,
    !dataset == lag(dataset) & !row_number() == 1 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0),
    number = cumsum(counter)) 

for_class <- cm013 %>% 
  select(dataset = number, x, y)

write_csv(for_class, here::here("data", "cm013", "data.csv"))
```



1. Find a partner

1. Read in the data

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
bakers_dozen <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/conj620-bakers-dozen")
```


1. `filter` for the dataset number you've been assigned

1. Confirm that you have 142 rows and three columns (one of which is dataset) (hint: try printing the dataset to your console)

1. Find the mean and standard deviation of `x` and `y` using `summarize`


---
class: center, middle

```{r}
for_class %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise_all(., funs(mean, sd)) 
```
---
## Datasets Exercise Part 2



1. Plot `x` versus `y` in a scatterplot using `ggplot2`

1. Discuss with your partner whether you think the summary statistics for `x` and `y` make sense, given your visualization.
