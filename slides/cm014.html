## Literate Programming

Literate programming is a technique for mixing written text and chunks of code together.

This can allow for easier documentation of code, **and/or** the production of a full written report that incorporates the code and results used to create it.

--

&gt; Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do.
&gt;
&gt; ‚Äî Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984

---

## How are these related?

[RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)!

- A powerful package for literate programming, reproducible analysis, and document generation, which can (often working with `knitr`):
    - Combine R code and **Markdown** syntax
    - Produce documents in not only PDF format, but Microsoft Word and various types of HTML documents *(like these slides!)*
    - In HTML format, incorporate "extras" like interactive graphics
    
---

## What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that allows you to quickly write and format text, which is then converted to different types of output.

--
.pull-left[
### Advantages

- Lightweight syntax: Less to learn/type than LaTeX or HTML
- Can do the vast majority of what you need with less effort
- Syntax resembles the finished product
]

--
.pull-right[
### Disadvantages

- Less control, fewer options than LaTeX or HTML

   *(...BUT you can also incorporate actual LaTeX or HTML if you need more control!)*

## Markdown Syntax

We want to write a paragraph where we **bold** some words, put some in *italics* and some in `verbatim`, include a

## Main Header
### And a Subheader

- bulleted
- list
    - with a
    - sublist,
    
and an

1. enumerated list
1. with a random number inserted, like 0.87

&gt; and a quote, like this

```

## Your Turn! (5 min)

1. Open RStudio
1. Run `library(rmarkdown)` in your R console
    - This package comes pre-installed with RStudio
1. Click `File` ‚û°Ô∏è `New File` ‚û°Ô∏è `Text File`
1. Read/watch one of these resources, and write some text in your text file summarizing it (2-3 sentences max). Format it however you like using Markdown syntax:
    - https://www.gapminder.org/topics/babies-per-woman/
    - https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality
1. Save your file with the extension `.md` (for Markdown)
1. In your console, use RMarkdown's `render()` function to create an HTML file:

`rmarkdown::render("myfile.md")`

For more help with syntax, also see:

`https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html`

---

## R + Markdown = RMarkdown


RMarkdown files combine **R code chunks** with **text formatted in Markdown**, and are always saved with the `.Rmd` extension (eg, `lab04_hill.Rmd`).

You can also include "inline" R code that is not in a specific chunk.

````
For example, here is text before an R code chunk where I generate a
random sample from a normal distribution.


```r
my_sample &lt;- rnorm(n = 100)
```

Then later, I want to refer to the mean, which is `r
mean(my_sample)`.

````
And it will look like I typed the mean is 0.0245981, but instead I calculated it using R!

## RMarkdown Output

Some options:

- PDF
- Microsoft Word
- [Beamer presentations](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html)

--
- **HTML documents**
    - Standalone documents, in [notebook mode](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) or not *(today's focus!)*
    - [`flexdashboards`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)
    - [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) slides like this!
    - [`bookdown` books](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) like [ModernDive](http://moderndive.netlify.com) and [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)!
    - [Websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.htm) like [our course website](https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-basic-stats/)
    - [Blogs](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) like [mine](https://alison.rbind.io)
    - [Tons more "in the wild" examples](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html)

--

You can create multiple types of output with the same `.Rmd` file:

`rmarkdown::render(input = "lab04_hill.Rmd", output = "pdf_document")`

`rmarkdown::render(input = "lab04_hill.Rmd", output = "html_document")`

---

## Anatomy of an RMarkdown Document

1. YAML

--

1. Markdown text
1. R code

--

1. Repeat 2 &amp; 3 as needed


---

## YAML 

- YAML = YAML Ain't No Markup Language (not helpful)

- aka "R Markdown front-matter"

- You can only have one YAML front-matter for each .Rmd file 

- YAML is the "metadata" - the data about your document - that goes at the top of your file and tells RMarkdown things like titles and document options. 



```r
---
title: "Lab 04: reprohealth"
author: "Alison Hill"
date: "2018-07-05"
*output: html_document
---
```

--

This is the *minimum* YAML most RMarkdown documents will have, but you can specify many other options depending on the output format you use. Examples to come!

???

The output line sets the **default** output format for this document.

If we specify a format here, we don't have to specify it in the render() function.

Or, we can specify the default format here, but use `render()` to create output of a different format - maybe we usually want to create a PDF, but at the end we also create a Word document to make writing a manuscript easier.

---

## Your Turn!

1. Open the test Markdown (`.md`) file you just created, and add some YAML to the top of the document.
    - Specify `html_document` as the output format.
1. Render it again, using `rmarkdown::render("myfile.md")`.
1. Check to make sure you got the file output you requested.

üö® **NOTE** üö®: *Even though we are not using LaTeX for formatting, you will need to have a TeX installation on your computer if you want to create a PDF.*

--

1. BONUS: Leave the file YAML the same, but use `rmarkdown::render()`'s `output_format` option to specify a *different* output format than the one in your YAML.

--

`rmarkdown::render("myfile.md", output_format = "word_document")`

---

## Putting the R in RMarkdown

RMarkdown documents are Markdown-formatted text, with "chunks" of R code placed where you need them. You designate an R code chunk using ``backticks ` `` and `braces { }`:

` ```{r chunk_name, [options]}` 

`    ## R code here`
    
`    ``` `

--

`options` include various things that you want to control for that particular chunk, including things like

- Figure height and width
- Whether to `echo` (show) or `evaluate` (run) that code chunk in the final document (*debugging tip! If you have a problem code chunk, set `eval = FALSE` so you can still knit, but leave yourself a note to fix it later!*)
- Whether to show warnings and messages

These are passed to `knitr`; you can see a full list of knitr options at [yihui.name/knitr/options/](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

---

## Your Turn!

1. Add chunk(s) of R code to your Markdown file to do the following:
    - Load the `tidyverse` and `gapminder` packages (if either needs to be installed, do that in your console, not your file).
    - Print the first 10 rows of the `gapminder` data (hint: just name it in your file).
    - Do a `dplyr::glimpse` of the `gapminder` data.
    - Plot life expectancy versus GDP per capita.
1. In the text portion, answer the following questions:
    - How many variables/columns?
    - How many rows/observations?
    - Which variables are numbers?
    - Which are factors?
    - Describe what you see in the plot.
1. Re-save the file with the `.Rmd` extension (because now it includes R *and* Markdown code).
1. Render the file.
1. BONUS: Change some options: Change the figure height and width using `fig.height` and `fig.width` *(remember that these are in inches)*.

Remember, you can find other options at `yihui.name/knitr/options`.

## The Power of HTML

- Interactive graphics
- Ability to include HTML, written by me (rare) or others (often)
- Floating table of contents
- Include code, without taking up visual space
- Include details, without taking up visual space
- Tabsets
- Make it look pretty easily

## Case Study with `reprohealth`

For the rest of today we'll be using the `wb_reprohealth` dataset.


```r
head(wb_reprohealth)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 9
  year  country    continent region    edu_gen_parity gdp_per_cap life_exp
  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
1 2000  Afghanist‚Ä¶ Asia      Southern‚Ä¶         NA             NA      56.7
2 2001  Afghanist‚Ä¶ Asia      Southern‚Ä¶          0.           117.     57.2
3 2002  Afghanist‚Ä¶ Asia      Southern‚Ä¶         NA            188.     57.8
4 2003  Afghanist‚Ä¶ Asia      Southern‚Ä¶          0.544        199.     58.5
5 2004  Afghanist‚Ä¶ Asia      Southern‚Ä¶          0.406        219.     59.1
6 2005  Afghanist‚Ä¶ Asia      Southern‚Ä¶          0.549        250.     59.7
# ... with 2 more variables: mat_mortality &lt;dbl&gt;, tot_fertility &lt;dbl&gt;
```

---

## Your Turn!

1. `File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown`
1. Leave `Document`, `HTML` checked
1. Add your title, save as `lab04_reprohealth.Rmd`

## Controlling Appearance with YAML

Our HTML document has some great features, but it's pretty plain. We can use RMarkdown's built-in **themes** to make it pretty.

.pull-left[
![RMarkdown themes &amp; highlighting](images/rmarkdown_themehighlight.png)

*From the [RMarkdown HTML document documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html)*
]

.pull-right[

```r
---
title: "Lab 04: reprohealth"
author: "Alison Hill"
date: "2018-06-05"
output:
  html_document:
*   theme: flatly
*   highlight: zenburn
---
```
]

--

Themes are based on CSS. If you know CSS, you can customize even more!

(If you don't, you can benefit from the hard work of others who do üòÅ)

---

## Controlling Appearance with YAML

.pull-left[
- Table of Contents:
    - `toc`: include TOC, only at top by default
    - `toc_float`: make the TOC "float" on the side
    - `toc_depth`: how many section levels should your TOC show?

]

.pull-right[
![TOC](images/toc.png)
]

---

# Your Turn!

Experiment with the YAML in your `lab04_reprohealth.Rmd` file!

- Change the `theme` and see what happens. Your options are:

    `cerulean`; `journal`; `flatly`; `readable`; `spacelab`; `united`; `cosmo`; `lumen`; `paper`; `sandstone`; `simplex`; `yeti`
    
- Change the code `highlight` and see what happens. Your options are:

    `tango`; `pygments`; `kate`; `monochrome`; `espresso`; `zenburn`; `haddock`; `textmate`
    
- Format your Table of Contents using `toc`, `toc_float`, and `toc_depth`.

## Your first and second code chunks

In my first R code chunk, I typically include any `knitr` options I want to set throughout the document.

````
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.path='Figs/')

```
````

In my second chunk, I load all the packages I need.

````
```{r load-packages}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(reprohealth)

```
````

---

## Your Turn!

Take this opportunity to add a setup chunk at the top of your `lab04_reprohealth.Rmd` file!

````
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.path='Figs/')

```
````

---

## To-Do List:

Here is the [lab assignment](../cm014.html)

Here is a "nutshell" version:

1. Read in and explore the `wb_reprohealth` data. 
1. Explore individual variables: pick **at least** one categorical variable and at least one quantitative variable to explore.
1. Explore various plot types: make a few plots, probably of the same variable you chose to characterize numerically. Try to explore more than one plot type. 
1. Bonus: try using inline R code to reference the number of rows and columns in the data.
